            <h1>General</h1>
             <p>Sepak Takraw is a volleyball-like game that originated in Southeast Asia. With a literal translation of ‘Kick Ball’ (Sepak in Malay meaning kick and takraw in Thai meaning ball), 2-4 players compete against their opposition
             on a court with a net across the middle. Unlike volleyball, in Sepak Takraw, players are not allowed to use their hands to play the ball and are required to use their feet, head, knees and chest to touch the ball. In addition, players are allowed to play the ball all 3 times.</p>

        <h1>Objective</h1>
        <p>In Sepak Takraw, the main objective is to hit the ball in a tactical way so that the opposing team cannot return it in a “legal” fashion.

            One team will begin the game by striking the ball over the net, which is known as a “serve”. Both teams will then compete in what is known as a “rally”, where the ball exchanges hands and flies above the net between both sides of the court. A rally finishes when one team cannot return the ball, and a point is marked for the team that forced the error.
            
            The team that reaches 21 points (by two clear points) first is declared the winner of a set, and two set wins are required to emerge victorious in the overall match.</p>
