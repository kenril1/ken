            <p>An inside kick is the most basic form of kick performed by Sepak takraw players. It is mostly used to control the ball. To perform this shot, players usually have to stand with their feet apart and then while bending their supporting leg a little, they need to hit the ball in upward direction using the inside of the other leg.</p>

        <h1 class="section-header">Knee</h1>
        <p>The knee kick is mostly a defensive shot and performed mostly while defending a serve from the opponent side. The knee kick actually utilizes the thigh to impact the ball.</p>

        <h1 class="section-header">Header</h1>
        <p>The header shot in this game is played using the forehead to hit the ball. This shot is played both as a serving as well as striking shot.</p>
